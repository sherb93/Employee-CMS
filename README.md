# Employee CMS

## Description
This Employee CMS makes is easy for any user to manage a company's staff using Node.js. After running the index.js file, the user is prompted to choose to view, add, or update information in the mySQL database. Database information is neatly displayed directly in the terminal.

This project utilized npms for better user experience:
- inquirer
- mysql2
- console.table

## Usage
Be sure to install Node.js and mySQL in order to run the project seamlessly.

Use your personal mySQL credentials in the connection.js file to run mySQL through the program.

The database can be created using the schema.sql file inside the "db" folder and mock data is available in the seeds.sql file.

Once you're ready to run the program, use an integrated terminal inside your code editor to run the command "npm i" to install all of the npm libraries located in the package.json file. After that's complete, run the command "node index.js" and play around with it. I hope you find it useful.
